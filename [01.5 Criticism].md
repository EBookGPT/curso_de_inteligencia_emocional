This manuscript, while showing promise in its exploration of emotional themes, desperately needs a rewrite to truly engage the reader. It currently suffers from a heavy reliance on "telling" rather than "showing," lacking vivid imagery, dynamic dialogue, and a captivating narrative flow. Here's a brutally honest critique:

**1. Overreliance on Telling:**  The prose is bogged down with exposition. We're constantly told what Mariana is feeling ("sudor frío recorría la espalda," "la vergüenza se apoderó de ella," "un nudo se formó en su estómago"). This leaves the reader feeling detached and uninvolved. Show us her anxiety through physical manifestations: how her hands tremble, how her breath catches, how her stomach churns. 

**2. Flat Dialogue:** The dialogue is predictable and lacks authenticity.  The interactions with the old man and Diego feel forced and exposition-driven.  Instead of "te gusta, ¿verdad?" try something more natural: "You're drawn to it, aren't you?"  "It's almost like you see yourself in it."  

**3. Lack of Narrative Tension:** The story lacks a clear conflict or driving force. The course and the characters seem to exist in a vacuum. Introduce obstacles, create stakes. Why is Mariana afraid of the presentation? What are the consequences of failing? What specific challenges does she face in expressing her art?

**4. Clichéd Imagery:** The metaphors and imagery are stale and unoriginal. "The world around her faded" is a tired phrase. "Her own dark side" is a common trope. Explore fresh metaphors to bring the emotional landscape to life.

**5. Awkward Pacing:**  The story jumps from one scene to another without a clear sense of progression. The "emo-magia" concept feels forced and lacks organic integration with the narrative. 

**Here are some constructive suggestions for improvement:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Focus on specific sensory details to evoke emotions. Describe the feeling of the cold sweat on Mariana's skin, the taste of the dulce de leche, the smell of the paint. 
* **Create conflict:** Introduce internal and external obstacles to raise the stakes. This could be family pressure, a rival artist, a fear of failure, or a personal crisis.
* **Develop believable characters:** Give Diego and Don Miguel distinct personalities, motivations, and flaws. Let their interactions reveal their complexities.
* **Use dialogue to reveal character and drive plot:** Make the dialogue organic, natural, and reveal something about the characters or the situation.  
* **Build tension and suspense:** Create a sense of anticipation and urgency. What will happen if Mariana doesn't overcome her fear? What will happen if her art is rejected?
* **Develop a strong theme:** Explore the meaning of "emo-magia" in a more nuanced and compelling way. How does it connect to the characters' struggles?

**Example of showing vs. telling:**

**Telling:**  "Mariana was nervous."

**Showing:** "Mariana's fingertips tapped a frantic rhythm on the table. Her stomach churned, sending waves of nausea through her. Her breath hitched, and she swallowed hard, forcing the lump in her throat down." 

By focusing on specific details and using sensory language, you can create a more immersive and compelling experience for the reader.
